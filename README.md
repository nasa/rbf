# rbf
Mode shape interpolation via radial basis functions

See Examples/hirenasd for scripts showing all steps required to prepare FEM modes for use in FUN3D. The scripts will have to be adjusted for your PBS envirnoment. Also make sure that fun3d and tecplot are in your path. 

The following help is shown by typing ./rbf without any arguments.

rbf Version: 2.6.0-e53e090

 Purpose:  Interpolate mode shapes from FEM modes to CFD surface.
   Usage:  rbf -s fem_mode_shape -d cfd_mesh -i cfd_mode_shape [options]
 Options:
           -s  source_fem_mode_shape_file
           -d  destination_mesh_file
           -i  interpolated_mode_shape_file
           -iz ignore points whose values are zero
           -nk number of source (fem) nodes to keep
           -pk percent of source (fem) nodes to keep
           -lk keep source (fem) nodes based on length
           -wp write fem_source_points for debugging
           -p  primary_surface_file
           -b  radial_blend_distance_in_grid_units for use with -p
           -x  symetry_plane_cordinate, use with -b
           -y  symetry_plane_cordinate, use with -b
           -z  symetry_plane_cordinate, use with -b
           -cs compute spring connectivity from rbf.nml
Requires:
          1) ascci formatted fem mode shapes with
             variables x,y,z,f1,f2,f3,f4,f5,f6
Examples:
           rbf -s fem/mode001.txt -d project_ddfdrive_body1.dat \
             -i project_body1_mode1.dat -nk 250 -y 4
           rbf -s fem/mode001.txt -d ddfdrive_allsurf.dat \
             -i project_body1_mode1.dat -p ddfdrive_wing_tail.dat -b 3 -pk 25
