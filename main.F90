!  
!  1. DEFINITIONS
!  
!  A. "Contributor" means Government Agency, as the developer of the 
!     Original Software, and any entity that makes a Modification.
!  B. "Covered Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a 
!     Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale 
!     of its Modification alone or when combined with the Subject 
!     Software.
!  C. "Display" means the showing of a copy of the Subject Software, 
!     either directly or by means of an image, or any other device.
!  D. "Distribution" means conveyance or transfer of the Subject 
!     Software, regardless of means, to another.
!  E. "Larger Work" means computer software that combines Subject 
!     Software, or portions thereof, with software separate from the 
!     Subject Software that is not governed by the terms of this 
!     Agreement.
!  F. "Modification" means any alteration of, including addition to 
!     or deletion from, the substance or structure of either the 
!     Original Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative 
!     works, as that term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC 
!     101. However, the act of including Subject Software as part of 
!     a Larger Work does not in and of itself constitute a 
!     Modification.
!  G. "Original Software" means the computer software first released 
!     under this Agreement by Government Agency with Government 
!     Agency designation LAR-19607-1 and entitled Mode shape 
!     interpolation via radial basis functions, including source 
!     code, object code and accompanying documentation, if any.
!  H. "Recipient" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software 
!     under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
!  I. "Redistribution" means Distribution of the Subject Software 
!     after a Modification has been made.
!  J. "Reproduction" means the making of a counterpart, image or copy 
!     of the Subject Software.
!  K. "Sale" means the exchange of the Subject Software for money or 
!     equivalent value.
!  L. "Subject Software" means the Original Software, Modifications,

!  
!  This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All 
!  rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and 
!  distribute this license without modification. This license may 
!  not be modified without at the express written permission of 
!  its copyright owner.
!  
!  C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the 
!  Subject Software as a Modification and must identify itself as 
!  the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably 
!  allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the 
!  Modification. In fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor 
!  must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes 
!  the alterations made and the date of the alterations, 
!  identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and 
!  consents to characterization of the alterations as a 
!  Modification, for example, by including a statement that the 
!  Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original 
!  Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is 
!  granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.
!  
!  D. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject 
!  Software. Once a copyright notice has been added to the Subject 
!  Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express 
!  permission of the Contributor who added the notice.
!  
!  E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject 
!  Software or in any promotional, advertising or other material 
!  that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or 
!  by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by 
!  Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial advantage by 
!  the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's 
!  participation in this Agreement. 
!  
!  F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of 
!  the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the 
!  Subject Software, is requested to provide Government Agency, by 
!  e-mail to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in 
!  clause 5.F., the following information: First and Last Name; 
!  Email Address; and Affiliation. Recipient's name and personal 
!  information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a 
!  Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that 
!  the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the 
!  Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how 
!  to access the Modification.
!  
!  G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is 
!  believed to be Contributor's original creation and does not 
!  violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or 
!  rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to 
!  grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.
!  
!  H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, 
!  warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to 
!  one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A 
!  Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on 
!  behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a 
!  Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
!  support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by 
!  that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to 
!  indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any 
!  liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, 
!  indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.
!  
!  I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject 
!  Software with separate software not governed by the terms of 
!  this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
!  product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject 
!  Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is 
!  subject to this Agreement.
!  
!  J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is 
!  hereby put on notice that export of any goods or technical data 
!  from the United States may require some form of export license 
!  from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export 
!  licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws. 
!  Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not 
!  be required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing 
!  granted herein provides any such export license. 
!  
!  4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES; WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION

!  PURPOSE, OR FREEDOM FROM INFRINGEMENT, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE 
!  SUBJECT SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE, OR ANY WARRANTY THAT 
!  DOCUMENTATION, IF PROVIDED, WILL CONFORM TO THE SUBJECT 
!  SOFTWARE. THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT, IN ANY MANNER, CONSTITUTE AN 
!  ENDORSEMENT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT OF ANY 
!  RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR ANY 
!  OTHER APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. 
!  FURTHER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND 
!  LIABILITIES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, IF PRESENT IN THE

!  RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT'S USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, 
!  RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE UNITED STATES 
!  GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY 
!  PRIOR RECIPIENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. RECIPIENT'S 
!  SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY SUCH MATTER SHALL BE THE IMMEDIATE, 
!  UNILATERAL TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
!  
!  5. GENERAL TERMS
